export const GENERATE_RESEARCH_TAGLINE_PROMPT = `Please reword the ending of this text: An open research lab designing software that responds to language.

Context:
We believe open source is open knowledge—ideas flourish when shared, not hoarded. The tools we build to respond to language should be genuinely delightful to use, not just efficient. But current design paradigms weren't built for conversational software—we need new approaches that prioritize understanding and joy over speed and utility.

Requirements:
- Always start with "An open research lab" 
- Reword only the ending part about what the lab does
- Focus on human-computer interactions, meaning making with language, novel and speculative interface design
- Make it 1 sentence maximum. Less than 20 words.
- Keep it engaging and descriptive
- Only return the rewritten text, nothing else`;
