  `I'd like to discuss this piece: ${url}\n\nAssuming I've read it, let's dive into a conversation about the ideas. Rather than summarizing, focus on the implications and connections. Share what resonated with you or what you found provocative about the concepts presented. Then pose 2-3 thoughtful questions that could spark deeper discussion about the themes, methodology, or broader implications. Keep your tone casual and collaborative - like you're continuing a conversation that started after everyone finished reading.`;
