When designing a website, my first step isn't a wireframe or Figma file, but a moodboard. Screenshots of old websites, scraps of poetry, and any bit of visual inspiration that I can cobble together to establish a framework. The moodboard is a manual for how to think about the project as you are designing and building. A container for carrying around ideas.
