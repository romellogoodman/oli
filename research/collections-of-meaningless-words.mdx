Do LLMs output having meaning? The question feels almost paradoxical when you consider that all words have meaning by their very nature. Each token carries semantic weight, references concepts, evokes associations. The tension doesn't arise from the words themselves being meaningless, but from the speed and sheer volume at which LLMs generate text. When machines can produce thousands of words in seconds, our traditional relationship with language—where each word is carefully chosen, weighed, considered—begins to break down. Yet even in this torrent of generated text, meaning persists. It's just harder to grasp.

In human conversation, we have a ritual for navigating ambiguity: we ask people what they mean. "What do you mean by that?" "Can you clarify?" "I don't follow." These clarifying questions are the connective tissue of understanding, the way we bridge the gap between speaker and listener. But what happens when the speaker is an algorithm that generated text through statistical patterns rather than intentional communication? What if we had a tool for doing the same kind of meaning-making with LLM writing—a way to interrogate the text itself?

This is precisely what we need: a tool for excavating meaning from the avalanche of AI-generated language. Something that lets us dive deeper into the meaning of words within their specific context, to trace the threads of coherence that run through seemingly random assemblages of text. The challenge isn't that LLM output is meaningless—it's that we lack the interpretive tools to extract meaning from the noise, to find signal in systems designed to optimize for fluency rather than intent. We need ways to gain meaning from apparent randomness, to make sense of collections of words that feel simultaneously profound and hollow:
