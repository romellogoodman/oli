There are two containers that come to mind when thinking through ideas: Projects and Prototypes.

Projects are the culmination of ideas. These combine and stack into frameworks of thought. Metaphors are birthed as a single idea doubles and triples in size. They accumulate over time into a product or end result.

Prototypes are for quick thinking. They help illuminate and expand the mind. They can facilitate consensus gathering and speed up the process of building by deciding what is worth investing in.

Projects are for long-term thinking and products are for short-term thinking.

These two vehicles exist in constant dialogue with one another. Prototypes create space for possibility and can test several possible directions that a project can head-down at once. A project might warrant a prototype to successfully replace or distill a bunch of ideas to their essence. Thereâ€™s a cyclical nature to this de/evolution.

I have plans to use both here and enjoy the fluidity these two containers offer.
