In 1986, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote about the carrier bag theory of human evolution—the idea that our first cultural device wasn't a weapon but a container. Not the dramatic spear hurled at a mammoth, but the humble bag used to gather wild oats, roots, and berries. The container that brings energy home rather than forces it outward.

"If you haven't got something to put it in, food will escape you," Le Guin observed. The same is true for ideas.

## The Heavy Bag of Working Thoughts

Working at Anthropic, I've accumulated a heavy research bag—notebooks full of observations about how people interact with language models, half-formed theories about interface design, prototypes that explore new ways of thinking about AI systems. Each person here carries their own container of thoughts, sharing insights across disciplines, watching how language and software dance together in increasingly sophisticated ways.

But ideas, like wild oats, have a tendency to scatter if you don't have somewhere to put them. And the most interesting ones often emerge not from the heroic moments of breakthrough, but from the patient work of gathering—from watching how a user struggles with a prompt, from noticing how a conversation takes an unexpected turn, from seeing patterns emerge across hundreds of small interactions.

## The JavaScript Moment, Again

I started my career in the early 2010s when JavaScript was exploding. React was the new kid on the block, and every week brought new frameworks, libraries, and approaches to building for the web. The energy was infectious—everyone was experimenting, building in public, sharing what they learned. The entire ecosystem felt alive with possibility.

AI feels like that now. Every day brings new coding agents, new ways of thinking about human-computer interaction. Websites are sprouting MCP servers, experimenting with markdown views, prompt links, llms.txt files. The web itself is becoming a more conversational place, and the tools we use to build it are evolving just as rapidly.

The energy is infectious. I want in.

## A Container for What's Coming

This is where Oli comes in—a research project exploring different ways to design software that responds to language. Not just another AI tool, but a systematic investigation into the fundamental questions: How should humans and language models communicate? What interfaces serve understanding rather than just efficiency? How do we design systems that feel genuinely collaborative rather than merely transactional?

Like Le Guin's carrier bag, this is intended to be a container—a place to gather ideas, experiments, and observations about the changing nature of software. All of our research will be open-source and freely available, because the best ideas tend to emerge from collective exploration rather than isolated heroics.

In the spirit of my previous books, I want to document this journey in public. Not just the polished conclusions, but the messy middle—the prototypes that don't quite work, the theories that need refinement, the small discoveries that might point toward something larger.

## What Goes in the Bag

So what will we put in this container? Explorations of conversation design. Experiments with new interaction paradigms. Studies of how people actually use AI tools in practice. Prototypes that push the boundaries of what's possible. Documentation of what we learn along the way.

Le Guin wrote that "the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings." A research lab, I think, works the same way—not as a linear progression toward predetermined goals, but as a space for holding different ideas in relation to each other, letting them inform and transform each other over time.

There's still plenty of room in the bag of stars. Let's see what we can gather.

P.S. - I turned 31 today. I start a new year with a new project. As I reflect on the new year, I am both excited and scared for what's to come. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past
