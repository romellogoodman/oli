Welcome to our first research post! This is a test of MDX functionality.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows us to write JSX in our Markdown files, giving us the power to create interactive content.

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

This post demonstrates basic MDX capabilities and serves as a foundation for future research content.
