> **Disclosure:** I work for Anthropic, the maker of Claude, as a design engineer on the brand design team. The views and thougts expressed are my own.

A new paradigm is coming to the web: open in claude, copy as markdown, view as markdown buttons. find them on the anthropic website. talk more about what each button does. Tech sites are adopting first because they are the prime client for llm sights.

But there is a human reason for wanting this. knowledge is more actionable. Why go to a website? One reason is if you could actually go deeper on the knowledge you get there. in other forms this looks like chatrooms, sharing links with friends but im interested if llms can help us here as well.

I wanted to have something similar so Ive added a discuss button to the research

It takes you to claude.ai because i dont want to rebuild a chat app at this time
