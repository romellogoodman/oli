randomness and computation create generative art. define it.

DEMO: genetrative art with a button to generate

when we have systems that have innumerable outputs how do we navigate and find ones that we like or speak to us

DEMO: add sliders and synth UIs (groups of sliders) to the generative art demo

but im interested in more visual ways of navigating these

DEMO: a 4 quadrant sliders on the generative art

DEMO: a 4 quadrant infinite canvas of the generative art
