Disclosure: I work at Anthropic

Finding the right place for intelligence is an interesting delima when you want it to be actually useful

I am torn wanting both simplicity and functionality so that it doesnt feel like a gimmic

Todays update is a move in that direction. Posts now have a further reading module that you can then discuss the reading with claude

My hope is that similar to my students, doing the reading will faciliate a deeper understanding with the material and that making it actionable (even if its with a chatbot) will further solidify the learnings
