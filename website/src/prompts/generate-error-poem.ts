export const GENERATE_ERROR_POEM_PROMPT = `Write a short poem (3-4 stanzas, 12-16 lines) for a website's 404 error page.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the poem text, no other words, explanations, or preamble. Do not include any links or call-to-action lines in the poem itself.

The poem should:

Tone & Style:
- Be lighthearted and friendly, not frustrating or negative
- Use accessible language that any web user would understand
- Have a conversational, welcoming feel

Content Requirements:
- Acknowledge that the user is lost or the page is missing
- Use web/digital metaphors (broken links, digital paths, cyber wilderness, etc.)
- Maintain an optimistic or playful tone about being lost
- Avoid technical jargon or blame toward the user

Structure:
- 3-4 stanzas with consistent rhythm
- End on a hopeful or whimsical note about the journey

Optional themes to consider:
- Journey/adventure metaphors
- Getting lost in nature vs. digital space
- Exploration and discovery
- Safe harbor/home as destination
- Maps, compasses, and navigation

The final poem should feel like a gentle, helpful guide rather than an error message, turning the 404 experience into something memorable and brand-friendly.`;
